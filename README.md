    Clean Flatpak Updater is a lightweight automation tool for Linux that updates only Flatpak applications, skipping unnecessary locale and runtime rebuilds.
    It uses a simple systemd timer and service to check for updates every 48 hours (UK timezone), log real app changes, and avoid daily update spam.
    Safe, efficient, and perfect for users who want quiet, controlled Flatpak maintenance â€” especially for frequently updated apps like Obsidian. [View Folder](/)
