# Useful Scripts Collection

[![CI](https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>/actions)

This repository contains small, reusable utility scripts.  
Currently included:

- **`check-mysql-health.sh`** ‚Üí verifies that MySQL is running correctly under systemd and responds to queries.

---

## üöÄ Scripts

### 1. `check-mysql-health.sh`

This script performs:

1. **systemd check** ‚Äì ensures `mysql.service` is active.  
2. **Ping test** ‚Äì uses `mysqladmin ping` to confirm MySQL is alive.  
3. **Query test** ‚Äì runs `SELECT VERSION(), NOW()` to validate MySQL responsiveness.

#### üîß Setup

Create a credentials file to avoid password prompts:

```ini
# ~/.my.cnf
[client]
user=root
password=yourpassword
````

Secure it:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.my.cnf
```

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run manually

```bash
./check-mysql-health.sh
```

Expected successful output:

```
=== Checking systemd service status for mysql ===
[OK] mysql is active and running.

=== Checking MySQL server responsiveness ===
[OK] MySQL responded to ping.

=== Running a simple query ===
+---------+---------------------+
| Version | CurrentTime         |
+---------+---------------------+
| 8.0.36  | 2025-09-23 12:34:56 |
+---------+---------------------+
[OK] Query executed successfully.

MySQL health check completed successfully.

```

## üì¶ Makefile Usage

The included `Makefile` installs **all `.sh` scripts** in this repo into `/usr/local/bin`, so they‚Äôre available system-wide.

### Show scripts that will be installed

```bash
make list
```

### Install all scripts

```bash
make install
```

After installation, you can run any script from anywhere:

```bash
check-mysql-health.sh
```

### Uninstall all scripts

```bash
make uninstall
```

---

## Security Notes

* `~/.my.cnf` is excluded in `.gitignore` so it won‚Äôt be committed.
* Use a **dedicated MySQL user with limited privileges** instead of `root` where possible.

## üß™ CI / GitHub Actions

This repo includes a **GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that automatically:

1. Ensures all `.sh` scripts are **executable**.
2. Runs **`shellcheck`** on every script to catch bad practices and common issues.

Workflow runs on **push** or **pull request** to `main` or `master`.
The badge at the top of this README shows the current build status.

---

## üìå License

MIT License ‚Äì free to use, modify, and share.

```

---

This is the **final package**. All scripts, CI workflow, Makefile, `.gitignore`, and README are fully integrated.  

You can now clone, push, and run everything immediately.
